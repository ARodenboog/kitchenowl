# Tips & Tricks
There are a few hidden features in the app which might not be obvious at first.

### Item description
When searching for an item you can add the `,` delimiter to add descriptions directly.
Did you also know that pressing enter when searching adds the first item to your shopping list?


### More details
Every card supports long presses to show details. So next time you look at your planned meals just long press and see how to cook it!
